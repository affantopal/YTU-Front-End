        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            My name is Affan Ahmet Bedri Topal, I am studying in Yildiz Technical University and I'm in my 4th year on Computer Engineering program.
            I'm glad to announce that this html file is my first step in becoming a front end app developer. This page is created to give you a brief knowledge about who I am.

        <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            I am mostly an extravert person who likes to spend most of my time with people I care the most. I love going to social actitivities and travel with my people. I generally don't like spending my free time alone. However, I spend my time listening to music or  
            explore new songs if I need to spend time alone. I mostly think that I have a very diverse music taste and I tend to switch between different genres on the fly. In my free time I also love playing video games but I prefer playing with a friend group to playing alone.
            I also like cycling and going to the cinema and theater.
